        Create a class called Person which accepts the name of a person as a string, and his/her age as a number.

        The Person class should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old". So for example, if John is 19 years old then the function describe of his object will return "John, 19 years old".

      Write yourself a virtual cat - animals with a CLI are so much nicer than ones with fur.

      Create an object that represents a cat. It should have properties for tiredness, hunger, loneliness and happiness
      Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties (there's an example in the slides). Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".
      Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area.
      Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts
      Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - sometimes make it so the cat doesn't want to be petted.
