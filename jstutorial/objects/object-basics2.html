    // In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands. The required members are:

    // name: A string representing the band name.
    // nationality: A string representing the country the band comes from.
    // genre: What type of music the band plays.
    // members: A number representing the number of members the band has.
    // formed: A number representing the year the band formed.
    // split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.
    // albums: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
    // name: A string representing the name of the album.
    // released: A number representing the year the album was released.
    // Include at least two albums in the albums array.   

    // Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable bandInfo, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.

    let bandInfo;

    // Add your code here
    const band = {
        name: 'Queen',
        nationality: 'british',
        genre: 'rock',
        members: 4,
        formed: 1970,
        split: false,
        albums: [{name: 'Sheer Heart Attack', released: 'November 8, 1974'}, {name: 'A Night at the Opera', released: 1975}]
    }

    bandInfo = `The band "${band.name}", a ${band.nationality} ${band.genre} band formed on ${band.formed}, with ${band.members} members who released their first album on ${band.albums[0].released}, named "${band.albums[0].name}". `;
