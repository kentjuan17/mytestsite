    // Finally for our object basics assessment, we want you to return to the cat object literal from Task #1. We want you to rewrite the greeting() method so that it logs "Hello, said Bertie the Cymric." to the browser DevTools' console, but in a way that will work across any cat object of the same structure, regardless of its name or breed.
    // When you are done, write your own object called cat2, which has the same structure, exactly the same greeting() method, but a different name, breed, and color.
    // Call both greeting() methods to check that they log appropriate greetings to the console.
    // The code is not very DRY (each bit of code should only be defined once) — you've got the same method defined twice, for example. Describe how you'd make it more DRY? If you are not sure, then don't worry — this is what we'll be looking at in future articles in the series!

    function Cat(name, breed, color, greeting) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
        this.color = color;
        this.greeting = greeting;
      }

    let cat = {
      name : 'Bertie',
      breed : 'Cymric',
      color : 'white',
      greeting: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, said ${this.name} the ${this.breed}`);
      }
    }

    let cat2 = new Cat('Snow White', 'Japanese Spitz', 'White', function() {
        console.log(`Hello, said ${this.name} the ${this.breed}`);
      });
